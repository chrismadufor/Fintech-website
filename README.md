# Fintech-website
This is a landing page for a psuedo fintech company called NairaBank

This page was written using HTML, CSS and Javascript. I chose these languages because they are the first I have learnt and they are relatively easy to build pages with.

Design components: 
The Primary color used was a dark blue color; rgb(0, 8, 54). This color is bold and it is visually appealing.
The Secondary color used is an off-white color; #eee. This color gives a great contrast to the primary color.
The Tertiary color is royalblue.
The font used is Gills Sans. The font is friendly and inviting.
